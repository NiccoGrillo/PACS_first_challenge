README contains clear instructions.
The code is well organized and readable.

The inheritance structure of the classes is a good idea and well implemented.

You could avoid using for loops for the operations on std::vectors using more efficient methods of the std library.

The extra methods are not implemented but there is an extension to 3d case.
